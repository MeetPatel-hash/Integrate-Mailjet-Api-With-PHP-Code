# Integrate-Mailjet-Api-With-PHP-Code
Send mail using Mailjet api and PHP code

# Features:
-Sending Test Email: The main feature of this project is to send a test email using the Mailjet API. The PHP code makes use of the Mailjet PHP library, which simplifies the process of interacting with the Mailjet API.

_ Mailjet API Integration: The project integrates with the Mailjet API using an API key and secret. These credentials authenticate the requests to the Mailjet service.

- Customizable Email Content: The email's content, including the sender's email address, recipient's email address, subject, and body, can be customized to suit the user's needs. The code demonstrates how to structure the email data in a way that Mailjet expects.

# Usage:
- Mailjet Account Setup: Before using this project, you need to have a Mailjet account and obtain the API key and secret. You can sign up for a Mailjet account at their official website.

-Composer Installation:  This project utilizes Composer for package management. To get started, make sure you have Composer installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official website.

- Install Mailjet PHP Library: The Mailjet PHP library is required for the project to function correctly. Use Composer to install the necessary dependencies by running composer install in the project directory. This will create the 'vendor' directory containing the Mailjet library.

- Customize Email Data: Open the PHP code file and update the $apiKey, $apiSecret, and email details such as the sender's and recipient's email addresses, subject, and body. Customize the email content to suit your needs.

- Sending Test Email: After configuring the email data, execute the PHP script. It will use the Mailjet API to send the test email to the specified recipient.

- Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling to detect any issues with sending the email. If any error occurs during the process, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

# Note:
- Make sure to keep your Mailjet API key and secret secure and avoid sharing it publicly or hardcoding it in the script for production projects. Instead, consider using environment variables to store sensitive information. 

- For more advanced use cases, you can explore additional functionalities provided by the Mailjet API, such as tracking email delivery, personalization, and email templates.

- By following the steps in this project, you will have a working PHP script that uses the Mailjet API to send test emails. It serves as a foundation for integrating email functionalities into your PHP-based web applications or projects that require email notifications or transactional emails.

# How to setup mailjet account :

Take some time to review and configure any other settings you might need for your specific use case. This could include setting up additional sender email addresses, defining email templates, configuring tracking options, and more.
That's it! Your Mailjet account is now set up, and you have access to your API credentials, which you can use in your PHP code or any other programming language to integrate Mailjet's email sending capabilities into your applications.
Remember to handle your API credentials securely and avoid sharing them publicly or hardcoding them in your code. For production applications, consider using environment variables or secure configuration management to protect your sensitive information.

# How to add composer to your system:
To install the Mailjet PHP library using Composer through the command line (CMD), follow these steps:
- Step 1: Install Composer (If Not Already Installed)
If you don't have Composer installed on your system, you can download and install it by following the official installation guide for your operating system:
https://getcomposer.org/download/
- Step 2: Open Command Prompt (CMD)
Open the Command Prompt or terminal on your computer. Make sure you have administrative privileges if you encounter any permission issues during installation.
- Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Directory
Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your PHP project is located. This is the directory where you want to install the Mailjet PHP library.
For example, if your project is located in `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\MyProject`, you would use the following command to navigate there:

```
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\MyProject
```
- Step 4: Install Mailjet PHP Library with Composer
In the same Command Prompt window, run the following command to install the Mailjet
PHP library:
```
composer require mailjet/mailjet-apiv3-php
```

Composer will download the Mailjet PHP library and any required dependencies, creating a 'vendor' directory in your project containing the installed packages.

- Step 5: Verify Installation
After the installation is complete, you should see a 'vendor' directory in your project, and it should contain the Mailjet PHP library files. Your Mailjet PHP library is now installed and ready to be used in your PHP project. You can include the `vendor/autoload.php` file in your PHP scripts to autoload the Mailjet
classes and use the library's functionality as shown in your initial code. Remember that whenever you distribute your project to other developers or deploy it to a
different environment, you should include the 'vendor' directory or run `composer install` on the target system to ensure all required dependencies, including the Mailjet library, are installed properly.

# Note: 
- You download this code after that you goto cmd and locate this file. After that test_mail.php add mailjet api key and password also add sender and reciver mail.Use this command for sending mail php test_mail.php . It will be sending mail from sender to reciver mail id.
